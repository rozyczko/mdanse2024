# MDANSE 2024 Workshop: Phonon Calculations of Periodics

Welcome to the MDANSE 2024 workshop project! This repository contains materials and code for phonon calculations of periodic systems using VASP and Phonopy.

## Overview

This project is part of the MDANSE 2024 workshop, focusing on the theoretical and practical aspects of phonon calculations. Participants will learn how to:

- Set up and run VASP calculations for periodic systems.
- Use Phonopy to analyze phonon properties.
- Interpret the results of phonon calculations.

## Requirements

- VASP
- Phonopy
- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mdanse2024-phonon-calculations.git
    ```
2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
