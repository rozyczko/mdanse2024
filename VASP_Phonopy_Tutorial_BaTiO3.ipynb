    "\n",
    "Now that the forces in the structure are close to zero, we can finally calculate its phonon modes. In this tutorial we use a **finite displacements approach** (or direct approach) implemented in the package Phonopy. You can remind yourself about the concept of lattice dynamics and phonons with this document: https://www.neutron-sciences.org/articles/sfn/pdf/2011/01/sfn201112007.pdf and read about the finite displacement approach here: https://www.neutron-sciences.org/articles/sfn/pdf/2011/01/sfn201112008.pdf.\n",
    "Finally, you can have  look at how it is implemented in Phonopy here: https://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/formulation.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "The finite displacements approach constists of slightly displacing each atom of the unit cell from their equilibrium position, and perform a single-point DFT calculation for each displacement in order to compute the resulting forces, called Hellmann-Feynman forces (HFF). Using the HFF, the force constants of the structures are computed and provide the phonon modes (the eigenfrequencies and the eigenvectors). \n",
